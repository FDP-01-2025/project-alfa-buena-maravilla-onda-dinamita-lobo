# The Table of Liars

## Description
"The Liars' Table." This game can be played by 2 to 4 players, and each player will be dealt 5 cards.
The deck may include Kings, Queens, Aces, and one single Joker, all shuffled and distributed randomly. The table (or a player, following a turn order) will 
call for a specific card (King, Queen, Ace, or Joker). All other players must then play 1, 2, or 3 cards face down (but not 4 or 5).
Once the cards are placed, players can choose to believe the one who played the cards, or accuse them of being a LIAR.
If the player who played the cards does have at least one of the requested cards, the accuser is the liar and loses the round.
If the player does not have the requested cards and played anyway, they are the liar and lose the round.
After the round:
All cards are returned to the deck, shuffled, and re-dealt.
The losing player does not participate in the next round and must complete a punishment or challenge.
The game will be implemented in C++, using:
-Functions
-Arrays
-Control structures like if, else, while, do-while, for, and switch.
